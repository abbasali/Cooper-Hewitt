Upgrading from single sign-on 1.x
---------------------------------

If you were using previous version of shared
sign-on, you will have to upgrade your current setup.

Using shared sign-on on multiple installations
----------------------------------------------

All you have to do is pick one of your installations as a master. Disable old
single sign-on module and remove it from the site.  Install Controller module
on master, install Client on clients. Then proceed according to installation
instructions in README.txt

Using shared sign-on on shared installation
-------------------------------------------

You need this if you are using Domain Access module and other similar module
allowing you to run multiple "domains" on one installation.

Overview: You will have to create a separate login site, then dump all your
users and sessions from current sites, create a separate database for them and
share tables across all installations.

1) Disable old single sign-on module and remove it from the site.

2) Create a separate login site, called 'master'. Example:
http://master.example.com, http://login.example.com,
http://sharedsignon.example.com

3) Install Drupal 6.x or 5.x on the master site as usual.

4) Create database used for shared tables. Example: example_com_shared. You can use following UNIX command:
mysqladmin create example_com_shared -p

5) Grant access to example_com_shared to the SAME user that is using old databases. This is essential.

6) Dump following tables on old sites: users, authmap, sessions. You can use following UNIX command:
mysqldump database_name users authmap sessions -u database_user -p > sso_users_install.sql

7) Import dumped file to shared database:
mysql example_com_shared --default-character-set=utf8 -u database_user -p < sso_users_install.sql

8) Edit settings.php on all sites including master. Change $db_prefix = '' to:

$db_prefix = array(
    'default'   => '',
    'users'     => 'example_com_shared.',
    'sessions'  => 'example_com_shared.',
    'authmap'   => 'example_com_shared.',
    );

9) You should now be able to browse all sites without any problems. You should have shared users between client and master sites.

10) Follow standard installation procedures in README.txt.
